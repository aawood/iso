WIP Faux-isometric engine

iso is an isometric 3D game engine currently in (early) development. The concept is to create an engine capable of
allowing game to be made in the style early home computer isometric games, but to run on modern machines.

As it stands, the engine will, when fed a tileset and having a set of objects hard-coded in, happily render them in
an approximately accurate faux-isometric format. Collision detection in 3 dimensions is a work in progress, as is a
"behaviour" system that will allow class-like interactions between objects.

Once the basics are in place, work will begin on player controls, interactive objects and abilities, interlinked
"maps" of multiple rooms, development tools to more easily generate and store rooms and maps, sound and animation
systems, and gui, as well as instructions on how to use the engine.
